## MADE Principles & Code of Conduct 

Version 3 \- 17/02/2024

***Definition:** Principles / Code of Conduct (**P/COC)** can be considered our Values, they are meant to guide the association and be voted into the association bylaws. These apply only to members of the association, new members will sign accepting the P/COC upon registering officially. Once enshrined in our bylaws (statute) they can only be legally changed with the vote of a large majority of the members. They are different from the **House Rules**, which can be changed with a quicker consensus of members and methods.*

**No discrimination**: We encourage diversity and inclusivity regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, political beliefs, ability, sexual orientation, gender preference, income, social class, personal appearance and other aspects of someoneâ€™s identity. Membership may be refused or suspended on other grounds (according to the organisation bylaws), but never because of prejudice based on who someone is. 

**Be excellent to each other**: always treat all other members with respect, kindness and tolerance. This applies to both in person and online interactions. Strive to learn and respect the personal boundaries of other members, so that everyone can share in the most enjoyable and productive experience. 

**Respectful Communication**: promote and respect the interactions among all members. As a community we try to be as open minded and tolerant as possible, but there are behaviours that will never be tolerated such as insults. 

**No harassment:** Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbally or physically threatening behaviour, deliberate intimidation, stalking, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, personal attacks and misrepresentation. This applies to both in person and online interactions.

**No hate speech:** Hate speech is defined as any form of communication (in speech, writing or behaviour) that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language towards a person or a group on the basis of who they are. This includes but is not limited to racist and sexist behaviour, comments, jokes etc.
