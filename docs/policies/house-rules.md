MADE House Rules
Version 3 - 23/01/2024

Definition: House Rules are the set of rules for people within the space. These rules apply to all persons within the space (the public as well). They outline the actions and behaviours we wish to have and not have within the space. They are more flexible than the P/COC and can be changed by quick member consensus (i.e. an online vote with consensus)

Respect each other
No insults - You can use any vulgar language you like, but do not insult, harass, or berate another person or their use of the space.
Be considerate of how your activities affect other members - auditory, visual, sensory, or other. We all share this space.

Respect the Commons
Use it but don’t abuse it. This applies to the space, equipment and common areas.
No sleeping -  the makerspace is not a hotel.
Fair Use - do not monopolise the shared equipment or space.
Clean up -  clean up after yourself and leave the space and equipment cleaner than you found it.

Tool Rules
Do not take tools out of the space.
After using a tool, put it back where it came from, in the condition that you found it.
Charge batteries after use.
Report broken tools or equipment immediately.
Always use the correct tools for the job (eg don’t use a screwdriver as a chisel).

Safety
If you see an unsafe situation, speak up.

Persons below the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or legally responsible adult - this is primarily an adult environment and not overtly suitable for children; members may be using strong language or could be discussing adult topics.
