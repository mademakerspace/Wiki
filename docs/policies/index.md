# **MADE Policies**

MADE is a non-profit organization and it is entirely run by its members, on a volunteer basis. The main ideology behind MADEâ€™s policy is: *Be excellent to each other*.

If you suspect that something you are planning would bother the other members, it's probably not something you should do. The rules are meant to keep the space running and keep the members happy. Proposals to amend these policies can be proposed and voted on during our General Assembly meetings; The House Rules are particularly subject to change.
