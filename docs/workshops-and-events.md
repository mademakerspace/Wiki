### Running a Workshop at ReMADE

All members have the right to run workshops in the space, given that they notify the other members in advance. Members can run free workshops for free, or for profit \- but if you plan to charge anything, you must inform the rest of the members in advance. 

We have hosted a variety of workshops and events in the past (this is not a comprehensive list):

* Woodworking  
* Metalworking  
* 3D printer DIY assembly   
* Arduino (introduction and advanced)  
* Raspberry Pi (introduction and advanced)

If you would like to organize a workshop, please propose it within the Telegram group and discuss it with other members at least a few weeks in advance.
