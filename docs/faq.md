Discover this Wiki, join the Telegram and introduce yourself, have fun\!

### Who can teach me how to use \[tool|program|etc.\]?

Many of our members know how to use different tools and would be happy to show you how to use them\! At times there are several new members who want to learn the same skill, so to avoid repetition we ask that new members start a new thread in the Telegram to decide which day and time would be best to meet. 

**Where can I leave my stuff?**

You can leave your stuff in a *labeled box* (the plastic fruit crates are perfect for this) on a shelf or somewhere else out of the way. If you plan to occupy more than 1 square meter of the space, please ask other members before you start your project\!
