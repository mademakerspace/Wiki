## Using the Equipment

* A few of the tools in our space are easy to break and/or dangerous, and require that you attend a training session before you may use them. Currently, you need training to use the laser cutters, CNC, and 3D printers. The golden rule for other power tools is: if you haven't used this exact make & model of tool before, please ask another member to show you how to use it safely.  
* Taking tools out of the space is prohibited.  
* Some tools have components that wear down and/or need replaceable parts (drill bits, sand belts, saw blades, etc.).   
* If you break or wear down something, you must buy the equivalent replacement. Save the receipts; in some cases MADE can cover the cost.
* Loud machinery and noises must end by 22:00 every day (sound curfew)
* Workbenches should be completely clean when you leave - be considerate for the next user.
Please put tools back where you found them
